                <h3>Model <span>& 1960 Boss-429</span></h3>
                <p>The Boss 429 is recognized as being among some of the rarest and highly valued muscle cars to date.[1] In total there were 1359 original Boss 429s made. The origin of the Boss 429 was to fulfil Ford's need to homologate the 429 semi-hemispherical engine for NASCAR racing. Ford was seeking to develop an engine that would better compete with the 426 Hemi from Chrysler in NASCAR's Grand National Division, now known as the NASCAR Cup Series. NASCAR's homologation rules required that at least 500 cars be fitted with this motor and sold to the general public. After much consideration, it was decided by Ford that the Mustang would be the car that would house this new engine.</p>
                <p>With the release and homologation of the Dodge Charger Daytona from its rival manufacturer Dodge, the Boss 429 Mustang is solely left as a road-going version and all of its NASCAR plans were scrapped. However, the 385 series Boss 429 engine itself was used in NASCAR until 1974 in other Ford and Mercury body platforms, and later in NHRA Pro Stock class during the 1980's, its main proponent there being Bob Glidden's championship winning Pro Stock Thunderbird.

                    The Boss 429 engine evolved from the Ford 385 engine. It used four-bolt main caps, a forged steel crank and forged steel connecting rods. The engine featured aluminum cylinder heads, with a semi-hemispherical type combustion chamber which Ford called the "crescent". These heads used the "dry-deck" method, meaning the coolant circuit for the block was separate from the cooling circuit for the head The "dry-deck" method of design is intended to strengthen the block by removing the open coolant jackets around the cylinder and reduce hot spots by providing more direct cooling. Each cylinder, oil passage and water passage had an individual "O" ring style seal to seal it tight. Although a head gasket is used, it only seals the cylinder for combustion so a failure at one point won't compromise the oth</p>
